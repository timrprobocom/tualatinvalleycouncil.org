Lane and Marie love square dancing but it took a few classes to get
them involved.  The first class they took was in the late 1980's and after
they graduated life's business got in the way and they never joined a club.
They took time out from their busy schedule and took another class in the
90's and didn't join a club.  Then when Lane retired in 2008 they took their
final square dance class with the Valley Squares and joined.
	They immediately became involved and Marie became Secretary and Lane
Treasurer of the Valley Squares.  During this time Marie was in charge of
re-writing the by-laws and the Practices and Procedures for the Valley
Squares.
	After they learned Plus they joined the Eager Beavers.  They were
instrumental in obtaining the Sunset Presbyterian Church gym for the Eager
Beavers' dance site.  Marie is the current Vice President of the Eager
Beavers
	Lane has been the Treasurer for the TVC for the past 3 years.  I can
tell you, he can have a report to me on who wins the attendance banner
before a dance is half over.  He will have the financial report on a dance
done by the next day.  
	He has helped re-write the TVC by-laws and Constitution, the P & P's
and just recently the Delegates Introduction to TVC document.  
	Lane is currently in a 2-year term as Treasurer of the State
Federation.
	With all of this I, Gary Clark, President of the Tualatin Valley
Council presents you, Lane & Marie Clem, this TVC Recognition Award plaque
for you to keep for 2015 year and these bars for your badges.
