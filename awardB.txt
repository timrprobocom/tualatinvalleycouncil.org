2021 Marks the 28th year this award has been given out. In 2020 we were not able to have our ceremony for this award because of Covid but we did have a winner. I did not want to present this award without having a ceremony for them so I decided to wait till we could meet.
As it turns out they were not able to attend the ceremony but that’s the way things have gone this last couple of years.
For the year 2020 Bob and Carolyn Bosch are the winners of this award. Some of you may not know that they are the ones that started this award 28 years ago and, in that time, they have been a big part of our square and round dance lives. If it weren’t for Sq-Dini Badges, we may not know the persons names across from us in our square and some cases we would not know who we are.  They have been involved with most all our major events, working hard at getting us the hardware we need. Along with supporting our clubs all year long.
I am very proud to be able to present this award to Bob & Carolyn Bosch for the year 2020. A year that will go down in the History books.
Congratulation to Bob & Carolyn Bosch
