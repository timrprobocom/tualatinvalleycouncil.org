<p>Our TVC Recognition Award Recipient Puts The Fun In Dance! &nbsp;He, together
with his spouse, love to dance and have been square and round dancing for
46 years. &nbsp;He is famous for dressing up for themed dances, dawning wigs,
overalls, and skeleton shirts. &nbsp;If you dance in a square with him . beware -
because you can find him &ldquo;breaking up&rdquo; squares by dancing the wrong 
direction and reaching for your hand when he shouldn't. &nbsp;Even as an expert dancer,
he believes you shouldn't take dancing too seriously. &nbsp;&ldquo;After 
all,&rdquo; you will hear him say, &ldquo;it's only a dance!&rdquo;
<p>
Our Award Recipient Is A Caller With Incredible Credentials! He has been
calling internationally, nationally and locally for over 44 years, most
recently for a TVC club for the last 10 years. &nbsp;He has been involved with
CALLERLAB, helping define our square dance standards -- and providing leadership
to his fellow callers. &nbsp;His fellow callers affectionally call him 
&ldquo;Dad&rdquo; -- not
because of his age but because of his wisdom and helpful nature.
<p>
Our Award Recipient Is A Very Special Teacher! He has conducted Caller
seminars and clinics in and out of the United States. &nbsp;But more importantly
for us, he has taught and is currently teaching MANY of our local potential
callers. offering ongoing classes in his basement and at a special college
each July in Cle Elum, Washington.
<p>
Our Award Recipient is Musical! &nbsp;Many of the songs you dance to have been
recorded and produced by our recipient. &nbsp;He was the owner and producer of
Chinook and Hoedowner Records.
<p>
Always willing to share his time, his expertise, and his humor for the sake
of square dancing.
<p>
I am delighted to announce TVC's Recognition Award Recipient - Daryl Clendenin,
Caller for the Hoedowners and his wife Yvonne.
